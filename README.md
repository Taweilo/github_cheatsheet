# 3. Image position
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12090472/how-do-i-center-an-image-in-the-readme-md-file-on-github
## 1. Align images left, right, or centered, with NO WORD WRAP
**Align left:**
<p align="left" width="100%">
    <img width="33%" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RJj4x.png">
</p>

**Align center:**
<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="33%" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RJj4x.png">
</p>

**Align right:**
<p align="right" width="100%">
    <img width="33%" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RJj4x.png">
</p>

<p align="right" width="100%">
    This text is also aligned to the right.<br>
    <img width="33%" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RJj4x.png">
</p>

## 2. Align images left, right, or centered, with word wrap:
**Align left (works fine):**

<img align="left" width="33%" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RJj4x.png">

[Arduino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino) (/ɑːrˈdwiːnoʊ/) is an open-source hardware and software company, project and user community that designs and manufactures single-board microcontrollers and microcontroller kits for building digital devices. Its hardware products are licensed under a [CC-BY-SA][4] license, while software is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) or the GNU General Public License (GPL),[1] permitting the manufacture of Arduino boards and software distribution by anyone. Arduino boards are available commercially from the official website or through authorized distributors. Arduino board designs use a variety of microprocessors and controllers. The boards are equipped with sets of digital and analog input/output (I/O) pins that may be interfaced to various expansion boards ('shields') or breadboards (for prototyping) and other circuits.


**Align center (doesn't really work):**

## 3. Align images side-by-side:

33% width each (_possibly_ a little too wide to fit all 3 images side-by-side, depending on your markdown viewer):
<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="33%" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RJj4x.png">
    <img width="33%" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RJj4x.png">
    <img width="33%" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RJj4x.png">
</p>

32% width each (perfect size to just barely fit all 3 images side-by-side):
<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="32%" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RJj4x.png">
    <img width="32%" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RJj4x.png">
    <img width="32%" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RJj4x.png">
</p>

31% width each:
<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="31%" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RJj4x.png">
    <img width="31%" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RJj4x.png">
    <img width="31%" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RJj4x.png">
</p>

30% width each:
<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="30%" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RJj4x.png">
    <img width="30%" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RJj4x.png">
